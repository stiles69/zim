Killing Process


Created Saturday 16 June 2018



We only want the listing associated with Chrome. So this command would look like:



ps aux | grep chrome
The aux options are as follows:



a = show processes for all users



u = display the process's user/owner



x = also show processes not attached to a terminal



The x option is important when you’re hunting for information regarding a graphical application.



Killing the process
Now we come to the task of killing the process. We have two pieces of information that will help us kill the errant
process:



Process name



Process ID



Which you use will determine the command used for termination. There are two commands used to kill a process:



kill - Kill a process by ID



killall - Kill a process by name



Signal NameSingle ValueEffect



SIGHUP1Hangup



SIGINT2Interrupt from keyboard



SIGKILL9Kill signal



SIGTERM15Termination signal



SIGSTOP17, 19, 23Stop the process



kill SIGNAL PID



kill -9 3827



kill -9 3919



kill -9 10764



kill -9 11679



Once we’ve issued the above commands, all of the chrome processes will have been successfully killed.



Let’s take the easy route! If we already know the process we want to kill is named chrome, we can make use of the
killall command and send the same signal the process like so:



killall -9 chrome
