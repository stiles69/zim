OpenSUSE


Created Tuesday 22 May 2018



Installing the 64-bit openSUSE Leap 42.3 / Tumbleweed using standard DVD
With the latest Leap version, and with the EFI boot protocol implemented in U-boot, it is now possible to directly
install from DVD on Raspberry Pi 3.



Note this guide assumes:



that you already have a Leap/Tumbleweed OS installed on your PC
that you are familiar with the openSUSE installation procedure
To boot the DVD there are multiple ways:



copying the ISO on a USB key
booting the ISO through the network boot (PXE)
For each cases, it is still needed to use a SD card to load the firmware and the bootloader (USB boot is also possible
on Raspberry Pi 3).



USB key installation method
A USB key (that can contains the DVD) and a SD card (at least 16GB) are needed.



Create a bootable SD card with the following partitioning scheme and format it - WARNING all previous data on the
device will be lost!


  # fdisk -l /dev/<sd_card>




  Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 14.5 GiB, 15523119104 bytes, 30318592 sectors
  Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
  Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
  I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
  Disklabel type: dos
  Disk identifier: 0x5d972dea



  Device Boot Start End Sectors Size Id Type
  /dev/mmcblk0p1 * 2048 206847 206847 100M c W95 FAT32 (LBA)


  
    # mkfs -t vfat /dev/<sd_card>p1


    Copy the Raspberry Pi 3 firmware and bootloader on it (note that the u-boot package version can change!)

    
      # mount /dev/<sd_card>p1 /mnt
# zypper -n in raspberrypi-firmware-config-rpi3
# cp -a /boot/vc/* /mnt/
# zypper -n rm raspberrypi-firmware-config-rpi3 raspberrypi-firmware
# mkdir tmp_uboot
# wget http://download.opensuse.org/ports/aarch64/distribution/leap/42.3/repo/oss/suse/aarch64/u-boot-rpi3-2017.05-1.1.aarch64.rpm -O tmp_uboot/u-boot-rpi3.aarch64.rpm
# cd tmp_uboot
# rpm2cpio u-boot-rpi3.aarch64.rpm | cpio -id
# cp boot/vc/* /mnt/
# cd ..
# rm -rf tmp_uboot
# umount /mnt




      Download the Leap 42.3 ISO (or the Tumbleweed ISO) and "burn" it on the USB key - WARNING all previous data on
      the device will be lost!


      
        # dd if=[image].iso of=/dev/<usb_key> bs=4M iflag=direct,fullblock oflag=direct




        Insert the SD card and USB key into your Raspberry Pi 3
        Connect the Raspberry Pi 3 to your PC via serial port (optional, but helpful for debugging; USB-TTL serial
        cable needed)
        Connect the Raspberry Pi 3 to your monitor (via DVI/HDMI, optional if you use the serial port)
        Power on the Raspberry Pi 3
        Stop the U-boot procedure by pressing a key (Not needed if you only have u-boot on your sdcard!)
        Change the boot order to force USB boot (Not needed if you only have u-boot on your sdcard!)
        Hit any key to stop autoboot: 0
        U-Boot> print boot_targets
        boot_targets=mmc0 usb0 pxe dhcp
        U-Boot> setenv boot_targets usb0
        U-Boot> print boot_targets
        boot_targets=usb0
        U-Boot> boot
        Your Raspberry Pi 3 is now booting the installation DVD!
        As the installation system suppose that you have a *real* UEFI firmware, a little trick is needed after the
        installation to be able to boot the OS.



        On your PC, you need to create a Hybrid MBR/GPT on the SD card for the Raspberry Pi 3 to be able to load the
        firmware/bootloader

        
          # gdisk /dev/<sd_card>


          GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.8



          Partition table scan:
          MBR: protective
          BSD: not present
          APM: not present
          GPT: present



          Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

          Recovery/transformation command (? for help): h



          WARNING! Hybrid MBRs are flaky and dangerous! If you decide not to use one,
          just hit the Enter key at the below prompt and your MBR partition table will
          be untouched.



          Type from one to three GPT partition numbers, separated by spaces, to be
          added to the hybrid MBR, in sequence: 1
          Place EFI GPT (0xEE) partition first in MBR (good for GRUB)? (Y/N): n



          Creating entry for GPT partition #1 (MBR partition #1)
          Enter an MBR hex code (default EF): 0C
          Set the bootable flag? (Y/N): y



          Unused partition space(s) found. Use one to protect more partitions?
          (Y/N): n



          Recovery/transformation command (? for help): o



          Disk size is 30318592 sectors (14.5 GiB)

          Recovery/transformation command (? for help): w



          Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
          PARTITIONS!!



          Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
          OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/mmcblk0.
          The operation has completed successfully.
          Insert the SD card with the openSUSE image into your board and power on it
          Congratulation! Your Raspberry Pi 3 is now booting your freshly installed openSUSE!
          Finally... have a lot of fun :)

          Troubleshooting
          I don't see kernel output on serial or HDMI
          If you don't see kernel output on serial or HDMI, you can try adding earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0x3f215040 to
          the kernel command line.



          I see HDMI output in U-Boot, but not in Linux
          The upstream Linux graphics driver for the Raspberry Pi has problems with a few monitors. The same applies to
          the 7" LCD displays. In those cases, please fall back to the efi frame buffer console by passing the
          following into the kernel command line:



          modprobe.blacklist=vc4



          I want to boot the same aarch64 image from microSD and USB adapter
          If you are using a Raspberry Pi-3B or later version and want to install on a microSD storage card that you
          can subsequently use to boot from either microSD or via USB (with adapter), refer to this How To [1]
