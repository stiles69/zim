Setup SSH on Raspbian


Created Saturday 17 March 2018




    Enable SSH on a headless Raspberry Pi (add file to SD card on another machine)

For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named ssh, without any extension, onto the boot partition of
the SD card from another computer. When the Pi boots, it looks for the ssh file. If it is found, SSH is enabled and the
file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter; it could contain text, or nothing at all.



If you have loaded Raspbian onto a blank SD card, you will have two partitions. The first one, which is the smaller
one, is the boot partition. Place the file into this one.
