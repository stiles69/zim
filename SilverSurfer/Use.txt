After installing it, you can run the ag command line tool with the following syntax.
**ag file-type options PATTERN /path/to/file**

To see a list of all supported file types, use the following command.
**ag list-file-types**

This example shows how to recursively search for all scripts that contain the word “root” under the directory ~/bin/.
**ag root ./bin/**

To print the filenames matching PATTERN and the number of matches in each file, other than the number of matching lines, use the -c switch as shown.
**ag -c root ./bin/**

To match case-sensitively, add the -s flag as shown.
**$ ag -cs ROOT ./bin/**
**$ ag -cs root ./bin/**

To print statistics of of a search operation such as files scanned, time taken, etc., use the the --stats option.
**$ ag -c root --stats ./bin/**

The -w flag tells ag to only match whole words similar to grep command.
**$ ag -w root ./bin/**

You can show column numbers in results using the --column option.
**$ ag --column root ./bin/**

You can also use ag to search through purely text files, using the -t switch and the -a switch is used to search all types of files. In addition, the -u switch enables searching though all files, including hidden files.
**$ ag -t root /etc/**
OR
**$ ag -a root /etc/**
OR
**$ ag -u root /etc/**

Ag also supports searching through the contents of compressed files, using the -z flag.
**$ ag -z root wondershaper.gz**

You can also enable following of symbolic links (symlinks in short) with the -f flag.
**$ ag -tf root /etc/** 

By default, ag searches 25 directories deep, you can set the depth of the search using the --depth switch, for example.
**$ ag --depth 40 -tf root /etc/**

For more information, see the silver searcher’s man page for a complete list of usage options.
**$ man ag**
