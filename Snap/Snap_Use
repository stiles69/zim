The Snap Store holds a collection of snaps for delivery to clouds, devices, and private infrastructures. You sign-in as follows, using your Ubuntu One account:

$ sudo snap login me@myself.com
Password: *********
2-factor: ******
Welcome!
When you are not logged in, most snap commands will require you to run them as root.

Find snaps
The Snap Store contains both public and private snaps.

Anybody can publish a snap, but doing a Snap Store search will only find snaps that are published to the stable release channel (and therefore have been reviewed and judged to be of good quality â€“ so users can install them without concerns).

Searches look for matches in the snap name or description:

$ snap find hello
Name           Version  Developer  Notes  Summary
hello          2.10     canonical  -      GNU Hello, the "hello world" snap
hello-huge     1.0      noise      -      A really big snap
hello-world    6.1      canonical  -      Hello world example
Community developer Brian Douglass maintains an online directory of the Snap Store.

Install snaps
You can install snaps using the snap name. Here is an example of installing GNU Hello from the Free Software Foundation:

$ snap install hello
Run snaps
Each snap might include multiple related commands, with a default command that has the same name as the snap itself. Additional commands are prefixed with the snap name:

$ hello
Hello, world!
$ hello.universe
Hello, universe!
Snaps can also install services that run in the background, such as web servers and daemons. Those will start automatically when the snap is installed. The snap disable <snap name> and snap enable <snap name> commands allow you to keep full control over snaps installed on your system, regardless of the way they are started.
