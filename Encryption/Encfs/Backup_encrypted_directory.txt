Backup encrypted directory


Created Wednesday 09 May 2018



An encrypted directory may be backed up and restored to another location like it is. This is possible, because the
configuration file for the encryption options/metadata is actually stored in the directory itself in plaintext in the
hidden .encfs6.xml file. This poses no direct problem, because the password is not in it.



However, if you - for example - store the backup on a remote location (e.g. in the cloud) or a portable device, you
might feel uncomfortable about it. In this case it also is no problem to manually move the file out of the directory
before creating the backup. You can even move it permanently and still mount and access the files, if you pass its
location to encfs via the ENCFS6_CONFIG environment variable. For the #Usage example above:



$ mv ~/.name/encfs6.xml ~/.
$ ENCFS6_CONFIG=~/encfs6.xml encfs ~/.name ~/name
