Mount via fstab
Adding an entry in /etc/fstab will allow you to mount the encfs volume with a simple mount /target/path and you will be
prompted for your password.



	/etc/fstab
encfs#/path/to/encfs/data  /mnt/decrypted  fuse  noauto,user  0  0

	


	The noauto option prevents an attempt to mount the volume at boot, which could delay the boot process while it waits
	for a password to be entered. user can be omitted if only the root user should be able to mount the volume.
