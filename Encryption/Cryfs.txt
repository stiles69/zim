=== Setup an encrypted directory ===
Once installed, you can create an encrypted directory by calling cryfs basedir mountdir. You can call the directories
however you like, we chose basedir and mountdir for demonstration purposes. If the corresponding directories don't
exist yet, CryFS will offer to create them for you.
**cryfs basedir mountdir**

//This will ask you some questions about the configuration of your encrypted directory. For now, we just say yes when//
//we're asked whether to use the default settings. CryFS will also ask you for a password and then you're good to go.//

You can modify files and directories in the mountdir directory. CryFS will then encrypt them and store the encrypted
data in the basedir directory. The mountdir directory is a virtual directory, meaning it doesn't actually exist on your
harddisk, but is provided by CryFS. Whenever you access files or directories in it, CryFS handles the decryption in the
background, so that you can work with mountdir as if it was a real directory. This way, even if someone steals your
harddisk, your data is still secure, since they can't decrypt it.

=== Using the encrypted directory ===
You can work in mountdir, add files to it, modify them, add subdirectories, and do whatever you want with it.
Everything you store inside will be encrypted and stored in basedir. The unencrypted content of mountdir will never be
stored to the harddisk, so everything on your harddisk is encrypted. CryFS uses an encryption scheme that doesn't only
encrypt file contents, but also the file sizes, file metadata and directory structure is encrypted. Let's take a look.

First, we create a file and a directory in mountdir.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
cd mountdir
echo "My file content" > myfile
mkdir mydirectory

}}}
