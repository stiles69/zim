====== Exit Codes ======

**1 - Catchall for general errors**
**2 - Misuse of shell builtins (according to Bash documentation)**
**126 - Command invoked cannot execute**
**127 - “command not found”**
**128 - Invalid argument to exit**
**128+n - Fatal error signal “n”**
**130 - Script terminated by Control-C**
**255\* - Exit status out of range**

=== How to suppress exit statuses ===
Combining both the suppression of error output and the OR operation the following script returns a status code of 0
with no output even though the file does not exist.

**#!/bin/bash cat 'doesnotexist.txt' 2>/dev/null || exit 0**
