a Note on Ssl Certificate Verification
Certificate verification as implemented right now [02.2016] only in the webdav and lftp backends. older pythons
    2.7.8- and older lftp binaries need a file based database of certification authority certificates (cacert file).

Newer python 2.7.9+ and recent lftp versions however support the system default certificates (usually in
    /etc/ssl/certs) and also giving an alternative ca cert folder via --ssl-cacert-path.
The cacert file has to be a PEM formatted text file as currently provided by the CURL project. See



http:curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html//
After creating/retrieving a valid cacert file you should copy it to either
~/.duplicity/cacert.pem 
~/duplicity_cacert.pem 
/etc/duplicity/cacert.pem
Duplicity searches it there in the same order and will fail if it canâ€™t find it. You can however specify the option
    --ssl-cacert-file <file> to point duplicity to a copy in a different location.
Finally there is the --ssl-no-check-certificate option to disable certificate verification alltogether, in case some
    ssl library is missing or verification is not wanted. Use it with care, as even with self signed servers manually
    providing the private ca certificate is definitely the safer option.
