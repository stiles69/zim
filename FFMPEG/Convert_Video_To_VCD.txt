Convert Video To VCD


Created Saturday 20 January 2018


ffmpeg -i /path/file.avi -target ntsc-vcd -s 352x240 /path/output.mpg




ffmpeg -i /path/file.avi -target ntsc-vcd -s 352x240 -padtop 32 -padbottom 32 /path/output.mpg



Requirements
ffmpeg - at least version 0.4.9 (previous version do not have the -target command)
[edit] Create a VCD
VCD has fixed bitrate, you have no choice but to encode using the default settings of 1150kbit/s for video and
224kbit/s for audio. This is the specification and must be followed.



You need to splitt the output video file to fit as many CDs as are needed.



ffmpeg -i <movie.avi> -target pal-vcd <filename.mpg>
[edit] Create an SVCD
The key to making a SVCD is to set the bitrate. Calculate it using this formula:



Number of CDs * CD size * 1024 * 8 / movie length in seconds = bitrate per second.
Subtract the desired audio bitrate from this value and you have a number very close to the video bitrate you want.
Encode at atleast 1500kbit/s for good quality; only use lower quality if you really want to add more minutes of video
at the cost of quality.
ffmpeg will calculate the bitrate setting for you if you use the -target option.



ffmpeg -i <movie.avi> -target pal-svcd <filename.mpg>
[edit] Burn The CD
[edit] Using K3B
K3B can burn VCD's for you and makes the files necessary - just add the mpeg video files.

[edit] Command-line burning
For SVCD:



vcdimager -t svcd -l "Movie Title" -c <filename>.cue -b <filename>.bin <filename>.mpg
cdrdao write --device <device> <filename>.cue
For VCD:



vcdimager -t vcd2 -l "Movie Title" -c <filename>.cue -b <filename>.bin <filename>.mpg
cdrdao write --device <device> <filename>.cue
Note: Based on your version of ffmpeg, you may need to prepend pal or ntsc to the target argument.



ffmpeg -i <movie.avi> -target ntsc-vcd <filename.mpg>
[edit] Troubleshooting
[edit] PROBLEM: How do I split up a big avi to fit many svcd's?
Determine the duration of the movie and use the "-ss" start switch and the "-t" time duration switch to chop the source
video into portions.



The following splits up a big avi (1 hour, 55 minutes and 29 seconds long) into three different svcd's (45 minutes
each):



ffmpeg -hq -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:45:00 -i <movie.avi> -target svcd ./m1.mpg
ffmpeg -hq -ss 00:45:00 -t 00:45:00 -i <movie.avi> -target svcd ./m2.mpg
ffmpeg -hq -ss 01:30:00 -t 00:25:29 -i <movie.avi> -target svcd ./m3.mpg
or



ffmpeg -i <movie.avi> -target ntsc-vcd <filename.mpg>
the following outputs m1.mpg, m2.mpg and m3.mpg



mpgtx -3 <filename.mpg> -b m
Alternatively, you can use the package avisplit. The command:



avisplit -s 700 -i <file.avi>
