Create An Animated GIF With FFmpeg


Created Monday 22 January 2018


Using the -an flag, similar to what we did above, is better than creating an animated GIF if you'd like to make a
    video without audio, but there are plenty of places that support GIFs that won't support a different video format.
    For all of those:




ffmpeg -i input.mkv output.gif



This command creates a GIF of the same dimensions as the input file. This is often a bad idea, as GIFs don't
    compress well relative to other video formats (in my experience a GIF will be around eight times larger than the
    source video). It may be helpful to use the -s option to resize your GIF to something a bit smaller, especially if
    the input source is quite large, such as HD video.
