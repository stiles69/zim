Concat Files With Same Formats


Created Monday 22 January 2018


Concat demuxer




The concat demuxer was added to FFmpeg 1.1. You can read about it in the documentation.


Instructions




Create a file mylist.txt with all the files you want to have concatenated in the following form (lines starting with
    a # are ignored):



# this is a commentfile '/path/to/file1'file '/path/to/file2'file '/path/to/file3'



Note that these can be either relative or absolute paths. Then you can stream copy or re-encode your files:



ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output



The -safe 0 above is not required if the paths are relative.
