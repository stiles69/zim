Extracting Audio


Created Monday 22 January 2018



Sometimes you don't really care about the video, you just want the audio. Luckily this is very straightforward in
    FFmpeg with the -vn flag:



ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vn audio_only.ogg



This command extracts only the audio from the input, encodes it as Vorbis, and saves it into audio_only.ogg. Now you
    have an isolated audio stream. You can also use the -an and -sn flags in the same manner to strip out audio and
    subtitle streams.
