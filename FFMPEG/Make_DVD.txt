Make DVD


Created Sunday 20 May 2018
source.mkv – The original source video file you want to burn to DVD. This is the only file you must supply, the rest
will be created.
temp.mpg – The mpeg encoded video file which will be actually burned to DVD.
dvdmovie – The directory which will store your DVD files during encoding (AUDIO_TS, VIDEO_TS)
dvd.iso – The final .ISO image which you will burn to your DVD.
/dev/dvd – The device path for your DVD burner.



To transcode the video to video DVD compatible MPEG2 and AC3, type:
$ ffmpeg -i source.mkv -filter:v
"scale='if(gt(a,720/480),720,-1)':'if(gt(a,720/480),-1,480)',pad=w=720:h=480:x=(ow-iw)/2:y=(oh-ih)/2" -aspect 16:9
-target ntsc-dvd temp.mpg



Next you need to add the MPEG2 video to a DVD folder that contains the “VIDEO_TS” and “AUDIO_TS” folders needed for a
standard compliant video DVD.
$ export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC
$ dvdauthor --title -o dvdmovie -f temp.mpg



Before we finalize the DVD we need to set the video format. In this case we will use the PAL standard. If your video
and TV standard are NTSC, please replace it accordingly. Since I have found no working way to set the video standard
using command line options of dvdauthor we will set an environment variable which will be read by dvdauthor when it
finalizes the DVD.
$ export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC
$ dvdauthor --title -o dvdmovie -f temp.mpg





Now we finalize the DVD with the -T option
$ dvdauthor -T -o dvdmovie



Congratulations, your video DVD is basically done now. To make backing up and burning the DVD easier, we will now
create an ISO image of the DVD folder.
$ genisoimage -dvd-video -o dvd.iso dvdmovie



Burn ISO
$ growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=dvd.iso
