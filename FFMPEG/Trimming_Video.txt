Trimming Video


Created Monday 22 January 2018



ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:av copy -ss 00:01:00 -t 10 output.mkv



This will copy the video and audio streams (-c:av copy) but will trim the video. The -t option sets the cut duration
    to be 10 seconds and the -ss option sets the start point of the video for trimming, in this case at one minute
    (00:01:00). You can be more precise than just hours, minutes, and seconds, going down to milliseconds if needed.
