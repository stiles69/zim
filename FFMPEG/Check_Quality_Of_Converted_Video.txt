====== Check Quality Of Converted Video ======
Created Sun 20 January 2019

The commands, in general, are ok.

One way to check the quality of the output is by comparing it against the original using a video quality benchmark. FFmpeg has two of these built-in: PSNR and SSIM. PSNR should be fine for general use.

You can run it using the command below

**ffmpeg -i converted -i source -filter_complex "psnr" -f null -**
At the end of the execution log, there will be a readout like the one below

[Parsed_psnr_1 @ 0000000000398320] PSNR y:42.63 u:43.19 v:44.09 average:42.90 min:42.07 max:46.16
An average value 40 or more is generally acceptable for casual viewing. Netflix uses 38 as a floor.

Thanks! I've tried it and worked perfectly with two identical videos I have in my pc (original and converted copy). however I have another question. I have read here both videos must have the same pixel format and resolution. But what about if I want to downscale 1080P to 720P? would that make impossible to use PSNR in the new converted video after downscaling it?

As long as you apply resizing to the original before you feed it to PSNR, you should be fine, e.g.

**ffmpeg -i converted -i source -filter_complex "[1]scale=hd720[sm];[0][sm]psnr" -f null -**
