Change the Quality of Each Stream


Created Monday 22 January 2018



Now that we have a handle on the codecs, the next question is: How do we set the quality of each stream?



The simplest method is to change the bitrate, which may or may not result in a different quality. Humans' ability to
    see and hear isn't as clean and clear cut as we'd like to think. Sometimes changing bitrates makes a huge
    difference to the subjective quality. Other times it might do nothing but change the file size. Sometimes it's very
    difficult to tell what will happen without trying it out.



To set the bitrate of each stream, you use the -b flag, which works in a similar fashion to the -c flag, except
    instead of codec options you set a bitrate.



For example, to change the bitrate of the video, you would use it like this:



ffmpeg -i input.webm -c:a copy -c:v vp9 -b:v 1M output.mkv



This will copy the audio (-c:a copy) from input.webm and convert the video to a VP9 codec (-c:v vp9) with a bit rate
    of 1M/s (-b:v), all bundled up in a Matroska container (output.mkv).
