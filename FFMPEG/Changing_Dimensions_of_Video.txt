Changing Dimensions of Video


Created Monday 22 January 2018



You can also adjust the dimensions of your video using FFmpeg. The simplest way is to use a predetermined video
    size:



ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:a copy -s hd720 output.mkv



This modifies the video to 1280x720 in the output, but you can set the width and height manually if you want:



ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:a copy -s 1280x720 output.mkv



This produces the exact same output as the earlier command. If you want to set custom sizes in FFmpeg, please
    remember that the width parameter (1280) comes before height (720).
