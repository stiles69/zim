Setup fstab on Pi


Created Wednesday 10 January 2018



Execute the following command to confirm your



Raspberry Pi recognizes the hard drive that you plugged in.



$sudo fdisk -l



Execute the following command to create the path you



want to use to mount the hard drive. The name "usbhdd" is for example, it can be whatever you like following Linux
naming standards.
$ sudo mkdir /media/usbhdd



Execute the following command to set up the user rights for your hard drive path.
$ sudo chown pi:pi /media/usbhdd



Execute the following command to mount the hard drive so that you can use it. Specify // media / usbhdd path, using the
name that you set up previously.
$ sudo mount -t vfat -o uid=pi,gid=pi /dev/sda1
/media/usbhdd



$sudo blkid



So in my example you will see /dev/sda1: LABEL = "HD256G" UUID = "1599-18FA" TYPE = "vfat". The information that we
need is UUID = "1599-18FA" and TYPE = "vfat". Your results will probably be different so you need to substitute your
information when we edit the fstab file.



$ sudo nano /etc/fstab



You can also use auto instead of vfat or ext3 to automatically have the system determine the hard disk format type. So
then the line would like the following.
UUID="1599-18FA" /medusbia/hdd auto rw,defaults 0 0



This change can be tested quickly by executing the



Following command. If the /etc/fstab file is incorrect you will see an error message as indicated below.
$ sudo mount -a



$ sudo reboot
