																																																																																																				CONFIGURATION


																																																																																																				You can configure
																																																																																																				youtube-dl by
																																																																																																				placing any
																																																																																																				supported command
																																																																																																				line option to a
																																																																																																				configuration file.
																																																																																																				On Linux and OS X,
																																																																																																				the system wide
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				is located at
																																																																																																				/etc/youtube-dl.conf
																																																																																																				and the user wide
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				at
																																																																																																				~/.config/youtube-dl/config.
																																																																																																				On Windows, the
																																																																																																				user wide
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				locations are
																																																																																																				%APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt
																																																																																																				or
																																																																																																				C:\Users\<user
																																																																																																				name>\youtube-dl.conf.
																																																																																																				Note that by
																																																																																																				default
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				may not exist so
																																																																																																				you may need to
																																																																																																				create it yourself.



																																																																																																				For example, with
																																																																																																				the following
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				youtube-dl will
																																																																																																				always extract the
																																																																																																				audio, not copy the
																																																																																																				mtime, use a proxy
																																																																																																				and save all videos
																																																																																																				under Movies
																																																																																																				directory in your
																																																																																																				home directory:



																																																																																																				# Lines starting
																																																																																																				with # are comments



																																																																																																				# Always extract
																																																																																																				audio
																																																																																																				-x



																																																																																																				# Do not copy the
																																																																																																				mtime
																																																																																																				--no-mtime



																																																																																																				# Use this proxy
																																																																																																				--proxy
																																																																																																				127.0.0.1:3128



																																																																																																				# Save all videos
																																																																																																				under Movies
																																																																																																				directory in your
																																																																																																				home directory
																																																																																																				-o
																																																																																																				~/Movies/%(title)s.%(ext)s
																																																																																																				Note that options
																																																																																																				in configuration
																																																																																																				file are just the
																																																																																																				same options aka
																																																																																																				switches used in
																																																																																																				regular command
																																																																																																				line calls thus
																																																																																																				there must be no
																																																																																																				whitespace after -
																																																																																																				or --, e.g. -o or
																																																																																																				--proxy but not - o
																																																																																																				or -- proxy.



																																																																																																				You can use
																																																																																																				--ignore-config if
																																																																																																				you want to disable
																																																																																																				the configuration
																																																																																																				file for a
																																																																																																				particular
																																																																																																				youtube-dl run.



																																																																																																				You can also use
																																																																																																				--config-location
																																																																																																				if you want to use
																																																																																																				custom
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				for a particular
																																																																																																				youtube-dl run.



																																																																																																				Authentication with
																																																																																																				.netrc file
																																																																																																				You may also want
																																																																																																				to configure
																																																																																																				automatic
																																																																																																				credentials storage
																																																																																																				for extractors that
																																																																																																				support
																																																																																																				authentication (by
																																																																																																				providing login and
																																																																																																				password with
																																																																																																				--username and
																																																																																																				--password) in
																																																																																																				order not to pass
																																																																																																				credentials as
																																																																																																				command line
																																																																																																				arguments on every
																																																																																																				youtube-dl
																																																																																																				execution and
																																																																																																				prevent tracking
																																																																																																				plain text
																																																																																																				passwords in the
																																																																																																				shell command
																																																																																																				history. You can
																																																																																																				achieve this using
																																																																																																				a .netrc file on a
																																																																																																				per extractor
																																																																																																				basis. For that you
																																																																																																				will need to create
																																																																																																				a .netrc file in
																																																																																																				your $HOME and
																																																																																																				restrict
																																																																																																				permissions to
																																																																																																				read/write by only
																																																																																																				you:



																																																																																																				touch $HOME/.netrc
																																																																																																				chmod a-rwx,u+rw
																																																																																																				$HOME/.netrc
																																																																																																				After that you can
																																																																																																				add credentials for
																																																																																																				an extractor in the
																																																																																																				following format,
																																																																																																				where extractor is
																																																																																																				the name of the
																																																																																																				extractor in
																																																																																																				lowercase:



																																																																																																				machine
																																																																																																				<extractor>
																																																																																																				login <login>
																																																																																																				password
																																																																																																				<password>
																																																																																																				For example:



																																																																																																				machine youtube
																																																																																																				login
																																																																																																				machine twitch
																																																																																																				login
																																																																																																				my_twitch_account_name
																																																																																																				password
																																																																																																				my_twitch_password
																																																																																																				To activate
																																																																																																				authentication with
																																																																																																				the .netrc file you
																																																																																																				should pass --netrc
																																																																																																				to youtube-dl or
																																																																																																				place it in the
																																																																																																				configuration file.



																																																																																																				On Windows you may
																																																																																																				also need to setup
																																																																																																				the %HOME%
																																																																																																				environment
																																																																																																				variable manually.
																																																																																																				For example:



																																																																																																				set
																																																																																																				HOME=%USERPROFILE%


																																																																																																				OUTPUT TEMPLATE


																																																																																																				The -o option
																																																																																																				allows users to
																																																																																																				indicate a template
																																																																																																				for the output file
																																																																																																				names.



																																																																																																				tl;dr: navigate me
																																																																																																				to examples.



																																																																																																				The basic usage is
																																																																																																				not to set any
																																																																																																				template arguments
																																																																																																				when downloading a
																																																																																																				single file, like
																																																																																																				in youtube-dl -o
																																																																																																				funny_video.flv
																																																																																																				"https://some/video".
																																																																																																				However, it may
																																																																																																				contain special
																																																																																																				sequences that will
																																																																																																				be replaced when
																																																																																																				downloading each
																																																																																																				video. The special
																																																																																																				sequences may be
																																																																																																				formatted according
																																																																																																				to python string
																																																																																																				formatting
																																																																																																				operations. For
																																																																																																				example, %(NAME)s
																																																																																																				or %(NAME)05d. To
																																																																																																				clarify, that is a
																																																																																																				percent symbol
																																																																																																				followed by a name
																																																																																																				in parentheses,
																																																																																																				followed by a
																																																																																																				formatting
																																																																																																				operations. Allowed

																																																																																																				Each aforementioned
																																																																																																				sequence when
																																																																																																				referenced in an
																																																																																																				output template
																																																																																																				will be replaced by
																																																																																																				the actual value
																																																																																																				corresponding to
																																																																																																				the sequence name.
																																																																																																				Note that some of
																																																																																																				the sequences are
																																																																																																				not guaranteed to
																																																																																																				be present since
																																																																																																				they depend on the
																																																																																																				metadata obtained
																																																																																																				by a particular
																																																																																																				extractor. Such
																																																																																																				sequences will be
																																																																																																				replaced with NA.



																																																																																																				For example for -o
																																																																																																				%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s
																																																																																																				and an mp4 video
																																																																																																				with title
																																																																																																				youtube-dl test
																																																																																																				video and id
																																																																																																				BaW_jenozKcj, this
																																																																																																				will result in a
																																																																																																				youtube-dl test
																																																																																																				video-BaW_jenozKcj.mp4
																																																																																																				file created in the
																																																																																																				current directory.



																																																																																																				For numeric
																																																																																																				sequences you can
																																																																																																				use numeric related
																																																																																																				formatting, for
																																																																																																				example,
																																																																																																				%(view_count)05d
																																																																																																				will result in a
																																																																																																				string with view
																																																																																																				count padded with
																																																																																																				zeros up to 5
																																																																																																				characters, like in
																																																																																																				00042.



																																																																																																				Output templates
																																																																																																				can also contain
																																																																																																				arbitrary
																																																																																																				hierarchical path,
																																																																																																				e.g. -o
																																																																																																				'%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s
																																																																																																				-
																																																																																																				%(title)s.%(ext)s'
																																																																																																				which will result
																																																																																																				in downloading each
																																																																																																				video in a
																																																																																																				directory
																																																																																																				corresponding to
																																																																																																				this path template.
																																																																																																				Any missing
																																																																																																				directory will be
																																																																																																				automatically
																																																																																																				created for you.



																																																																																																				To use percent
																																																																																																				literals in an
																																																																																																				output template use
																																																																																																				%%. To output to
																																																																																																				stdout use -o -.



																																																																																																				The current default
																																																																																																				template is
																																																																																																				%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s.



																																																																																																				In some cases, you
																																																																																																				don't want special
																																																																																																				characters such as
																																																																																																				中, spaces, or
																																																																																																				&amp;, such as when
																																																																																																				transferring the
																																																																																																				downloaded filename
																																																																																																				to a Windows system
																																																																																																				or the filename
																																																																																																				through an
																																																																																																				8bit-unsafe
																																																																																																				channel. In these
																																																																																																				cases, add the
																																																																																																				--restrict-filenames
																																																																																																				flag to get a
																																																																																																				shorter title:



																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl
																																																																																																				--get-filename -o
																																																																																																				'%(title)s.%(ext)s'
																																																																																																				BaW_jenozKc
																																																																																																				youtube-dl test
																																																																																																				video ''_ä↭𝕐.mp4 #
																																																																																																				All kinds of weird
																																																																																																				characters



																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl
																																																																																																				--get-filename -o
																																																																																																				'%(title)s.%(ext)s'

																																																																																																				FORMAT
																																																																																																					SELECTION


																																																																																																				By default
																																																																																																				youtube-dl tries to
																																																																																																				download the best
																																																																																																				available quality,
																																																																																																				i.e. if you want
																																																																																																				the best quality
																																																																																																				you don't need to
																																																																																																				pass any special
																																																																																																				options, youtube-dl
																																																																																																				will guess it for
																																																																																																				you by default.



																																																																																																				But sometimes you
																																																																																																				may want to
																																																																																																				download in a
																																																																																																				different format,
																																																																																																				for example when
																																																																																																				you are on a slow
																																																																																																				or intermittent
																																																																																																				connection. The key
																																																																																																				mechanism for
																																																																																																				achieving this is
																																																																																																				so-called format
																																																																																																				selection based on
																																																																																																				which you can
																																																																																																				explicitly specify
																																																																																																				desired format,
																																																																																																				select formats
																																																																																																				based on some
																																																																																																				criterion or
																																																																																																				criteria, setup
																																																																																																				precedence and much
																																																																																																				more.



																																																																																																				The general syntax
																																																																																																				for format
																																																																																																				selection is
																																																																																																				--format FORMAT or
																																																																																																				shorter -f FORMAT
																																																																																																				where FORMAT is a
																																																																																																				selector
																																																																																																				expression, i.e. an
																																																																																																				expression that
																																																																																																				describes format or
																																																																																																				formats you would
																																																																																																				like to download.



																																																																																																				tl;dr: navigate me
																																																																																																				to examples.



																																																																																																				The simplest case
																																																																																																				is requesting a
																																																																																																				specific format,
																																																																																																				for example with -f
																																																																																																				22 you can download
																																																																																																				the format with
																																																																																																				format code equal
																																																																																																				to 22. You can get
																																																																																																				the list of
																																																																																																				available format
																																																																																																				codes for
																																																																																																				particular video
																																																																																																				using
																																																																																																				--list-formats or
																																																																																																				-F. Note that these
																																																																																																				format codes are
																																																																																																				extractor specific.



																																																																																																				You can also use a
																																																																																																				file extension
																																																																																																				(currently 3gp,
																																																																																																				aac, flv, m4a, mp3,
																																																																																																				mp4, ogg, wav, webm
																																																																																																				are supported) to
																																																																																																				download the best
																																																																																																				quality format of a
																																																																																																				particular file
																																																																																																				extension served as
																																																																																																				a single file, e.g.
																																																																																																				-f webm will
																																																																																																				download the best
																																																																																																				quality format with
																																																																																																				the webm extension
																																																																																																				served as a single
																																																																																																				file.



																																																																																																				You can also use
																																																																																																				special names to
																																																																																																				select particular
																																																																																																				edge case formats:



																																																																																																				best: Select the
																																																																																																				best quality format
																																																																																																				represented by a
																																																																																																				single file with
																																																																																																				video and audio.
																																																																																																				worst: Select the
																																																																																																				worst quality
																																																																																																				format represented
																																																																																																				by a single file
																																																																																																				with video and
																																																																																																				audio.
																																																																																																				bestvideo: Select
																																																																																																				the best quality
																																																																																																				video-only format
																																																																																																				(e.g. DASH video).
																																																																																																				May not be
																																																																																																				available.
																																																																																																				worstvideo: Select
																																																																																																				the worst quality
																																																																																																				video-only format.
																																																																																																				May not be
																																																																																																				available.
																																																																																																				bestaudio: Select
																																																																																																				the best quality
																																																																																																				audio only-format.
																																																																																																				May not be
																																																																																																				available.
																																																																																																				worstaudio: Select
																																																																																																				the worst quality
																																																																																																				audio only-format.
																																																																																																				May not be
																																																																																																				available.
																																																																																																				For example, to
																																																																																																				download the worst
																																																																																																				quality video-only
																																																																																																				format you can use
																																																																																																				-f worstvideo.



																																																																																																				If you want to
																																																																																																				download multiple
																																																																																																				videos and they
																																																																																																				don't have the same
																																																																																																				formats available,
																																																																																																				you can specify the
																																																																																																				order of preference
																																																																																																				using slashes. Note
																																																																																																				that slash is
																																																																																																				left-associative,
																																																																																																				i.e. formats on the
																																																																																																				left hand side are
																																																																																																				preferred, for
																																																																																																				example -f 22/17/18
																																																																																																				will download
																																																																																																				format 22 if it's
																																																																																																				available,
																																																																																																				otherwise it will
																																																																																																				download format 17
																																																																																																				if it's available,
																																																																																																				otherwise it will
																																																																																																				download format 18
																																																																																																				if it's available,
																																																																																																				otherwise it will
																																																																																																				complain that no
																																																																																																				suitable formats
																																																																																																				are available for
																																																																																																				download.



																																																																																																				If you want to
																																																																																																				download several
																																																																																																				formats of the same
																																																																																																				video use a comma
																																																																																																				as a separator,
																																																																																																				e.g. -f 22,17,18
																																																																																																				will download all
																																																																																																				these three
																																																																																																				formats, of course
																																																																																																				if they are
																																																																																																				available. Or a
																																																																																																				more sophisticated
																																																																																																				example combined
																																																																																																				with the precedence
																																																																																																				feature: -f
																																																																																																				136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio.



																																																																																																				You can also filter
																																																																																																				the video formats
																																																																																																				by putting a
																																																																																																				condition in
																																																																																																				brackets, as in -f
																																																																																																				"best[height=720]"
																																																																																																				(or -f
																																																																																																				"[filesize>10M]").



																																																																																																				The following
																																																																																																				numeric meta fields
																																																																																																				can be used with
																																																																																																				comparisons <,
																																																																																																				<=, >, >=,
																																																																																																				= (equals), != (not
																																																																																																				equals):



																																																																																																				filesize: The
																																																																																																				number of bytes, if
																																																																																																				known in advance
																																																																																																				width: Width of the
																																																																																																				video, if known
																																																																																																				height: Height of
																																																																																																				the video, if known
																																																																																																				tbr: Average
																																																																																																				bitrate of audio
																																																																																																				and video in KBit/s
																																																																																																				abr: Average audio
																																																																																																				bitrate in KBit/s
																																																																																																				vbr: Average video
																																																																																																				bitrate in KBit/s
																																																																																																				asr: Audio sampling
																																																																																																				rate in Hertz
																																																																																																				fps: Frame rate
																																																																																																				Also filtering work
																																																																																																				for comparisons =
																																																																																																				(equals), != (not
																																																																																																				equals), ^= (begins
																																																																																																				with), $= (ends
																																																																																																				with), *=
																																																																																																				(contains) and
																																																																																																				following string
																																																																																																				meta fields:



																																																																																																				ext: File extension
																																																																																																				acodec: Name of the
																																																																																																				audio codec in use
																																																																																																				vcodec: Name of the
																																																																																																				video codec in use
																																																																																																				container: Name of
																																																																																																				the container
																																																																																																				format
																																																																																																				protocol: The
																																																																																																				protocol that will
																																																																																																				be used for the
																																																																																																				actual download,
																																																																																																				lower-case (http,
																																																																																																				https, rtsp, rtmp,
																																																																																																				rtmpe, mms, f4m,
																																																																																																				ism,
																																																																																																				http_dash_segments,
																																																																																																				m3u8, or
																																																																																																				m3u8_native)
																																																																																																				format_id: A short
																																																																																																				description of the
																																																																																																				format
																																																																																																				Note that none of
																																																																																																				the aforementioned
																																																																																																				meta fields are
																																																																																																				guaranteed to be
																																																																																																				present since this
																																																																																																				solely depends on
																																																																																																				the metadata
																																																																																																				obtained by
																																																																																																				particular
																																																																																																				extractor, i.e. the
																																																																																																				metadata offered by
																																																																																																				the video hoster.



																																																																																																				Formats for which
																																																																																																				the value is not
																																																																																																				known are excluded
																																																																																																				unless you put a
																																																																																																				question mark (?)
																																																																																																				after the operator.
																																																																																																				You can combine
																																																																																																				format filters, so
																																																																																																				-f "[height <=?
																																																																																																				720][tbr>500]"
																																																																																																				selects up to 720p
																																																																																																				videos (or videos
																																																																																																				where the height is
																																																																																																				not known) with a
																																																																																																				bitrate of at least
																																																																																																				500 KBit/s.



																																																																																																				You can merge the
																																																																																																				video and audio of
																																																																																																				two formats into a
																																																																																																				single file using
																																																																																																				-f
																																																																																																				<video-format>+<audio-format>
																																																																																																				(requires ffmpeg or
																																																																																																				avconv installed),
																																																																																																				for example -f
																																																																																																				bestvideo+bestaudio
																																																																																																				will download the
																																																																																																				best video-only
																																																																																																				format, the best
																																																																																																				audio-only format
																																																																																																				and mux them
																																																																																																				together with
																																																																																																				ffmpeg/avconv.



																																																																																																				Format selectors
																																																																																																				can also be grouped
																																																																																																				using parentheses,
																																																																																																				for example if you
																																																																																																				want to download
																																																																																																				the best mp4 and
																																																																																																				webm formats with a
																																																																																																				height lower than
																																																																																																				480 you can use -f
																																																																																																				'(mp4,webm)[height<480]'.



																																																																																																				Since the end of
																																																																																																				April 2015 and
																																																																																																				version 2015.04.26,
																																																																																																				youtube-dl uses -f
																																																																																																				bestvideo+bestaudio/best
																																																																																																				as the default
																																																																																																				format selection
																																																																																																				(see #5447, #5456).
																																																																																																				If ffmpeg or avconv
																																																																																																				are installed this
																																																																																																				results in
																																																																																																				downloading
																																																																																																				bestvideo and
																																																																																																				bestaudio
																																																																																																				separately and
																																																																																																				muxing them
																																																																																																				together into a
																																																																																																				single file giving
																																																																																																				the best overall
																																																																																																				quality available.
																																																																																																				Otherwise it falls
																																																																																																				back to best and
																																																																																																				results in
																																																																																																				downloading the
																																																																																																				best available
																																																																																																				quality served as a
																																																																																																				single file. best
																																																																																																				is also needed for
																																																																																																				videos that don't
																																																																																																				come from YouTube
																																																																																																				because they don't
																																																																																																				provide the audio
																																																																																																				and video in two
																																																																																																				different files. If
																																																																																																				you want to only
																																																																																																				download some DASH
																																																																																																				formats (for
																																																																																																				example if you are
																																																																																																				not interested in
																																																																																																				getting videos with
																																																																																																				a resolution higher
																																																																																																				than 1080p), you
																																																																																																				can add -f
																																																																																																				bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best
																																																																																																				to your
																																																																																																				configuration file.
																																																																																																				Note that if you
																																																																																																				use youtube-dl to
																																																																																																				stream to stdout
																																																																																																				(and most likely to
																																																																																																				pipe it to your
																																																																																																				media player then),
																																																																																																				i.e. you explicitly
																																																																																																				specify output
																																																																																																				template as -o -,
																																																																																																				youtube-dl still
																																																																																																				uses -f best format
																																																																																																				selection in order
																																																																																																				to start content
																																																																																																				delivery
																																																																																																				immediately to your
																																																																																																				player and not to
																																																																																																				wait until
																																																																																																				bestvideo and
																																																																																																				bestaudio are
																																																																																																				downloaded and
																																																																																																				muxed.



																																																																																																				If you want to
																																																																																																				preserve the old
																																																																																																				format selection
																																																																																																				behavior (prior to
																																																																																																				youtube-dl
																																																																																																				2015.04.26), i.e.
																																																																																																				you want to
																																																																																																				download the best
																																																																																																				available quality
																																																																																																				media served as a
																																																																																																				single file, you
																																																																																																				should explicitly
																																																																																																				specify your choice
																																																																																																				with -f best. You
																																																																																																				may want to add it
																																																																																																				to the
																																																																																																				configuration file
																																																																																																				in order not to
																																																																																																				type it every time
																																																																																																				you run youtube-dl.

																																																																																																				examples
																																																																																																				Note that on
																																																																																																				Windows you may
																																																																																																				need to use double
																																																																																																				quotes instead of
																																																																																																				single.



																																																																																																				# Download best mp4
																																																																																																				format available or
																																																																																																				any other best if
																																																																																																				no mp4 available
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl -f
																																																																																																				'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best'



																																																																																																				# Download best
																																																																																																				format available
																																																																																																				but not better that
																																																																																																				480p
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl -f
																																																																																																				'bestvideo[height<=480]+bestaudio/best[height<=480]'



																																																																																																				# Download best
																																																																																																				video only format
																																																																																																				but no bigger than
																																																																																																				50 MB
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl -f
																																																																																																				'best[filesize<50M]'



																																																																																																				# Download best
																																																																																																				format available
																																																																																																				via direct link
																																																																																																				over HTTP/HTTPS
																																																																																																				protocol
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl -f
																																																																																																				'(bestvideo+bestaudio/best)[protocol^=http]'



																																																																																																				# Download the best
																																																																																																				video format and
																																																																																																				the best audio
																																																																																																				format without
																																																																																																				merging them
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl -f
																																																																																																				'bestvideo,bestaudio'
																																																																																																				-o
																																																																																																				'%(title)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s'
																																																																																																				Note that in the
																																																																																																				last example, an
																																																																																																				output template is
																																																																																																				recommended as
																																																																																																				bestvideo and
																																																																																																				bestaudio may have
																																																																																																				the same file name.


																																																																																																				VIDEO SELECTION


																																																																																																				Videos can be
																																																																																																				filtered by their
																																																																																																				upload date using
																																																																																																				the options --date,
																																																																																																				--datebefore or
																																																																																																				--dateafter. They
																																																																																																				accept dates in two
																																																																																																				formats:



																																																																																																				Absolute dates:
																																																																																																				Dates in the format
																																																																																																				YYYYMMDD.
																																																																																																				Relative dates:
																																																																																																				Dates in the format
																																																																																																				(now|today)[+-][0-9](day|week|month|year)(s)?
																																																																																																				Examples:



																																																																																																				# Download only the
																																																																																																				videos uploaded in
																																																																																																				the last 6 months
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl
																																																																																																				--dateafter
																																																																																																				now-6months



																																																																																																				# Download only the
																																																																																																				videos uploaded on
																																																																																																				January 1, 1970
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl --date
																																																																																																				19700101



																																																																																																				$ # Download only
																																																																																																				the videos uploaded
																																																																																																				in the 200x decade
																																																																																																				$ youtube-dl
																																																																																																				--dateafter
																																																																																																				20000101
																																																																																																				--datebefore
																																																																																																				20091231
