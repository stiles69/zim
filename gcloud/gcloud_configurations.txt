gcloud configurations


Created Tuesday 20 March 2018



Creating a configuration
To create a configuration, run gcloud config configurations create:



gcloud config configurations create [NAME]
You must activate the new configuration after creation in order to use it.



Activating a configuration
Only one of your multiple configurations can be active at a given time. The active configuration is the configuration
whose properties will govern the behavior of the SDK tools.



To activate a new configuration or switch to a new active configuration, run: gcloud config configurations activate:



gcloud config configurations activate [NAME]
gcloud config list will always show you the properties in in your active configuration.



Viewing configuration properties
To view the properties in a configuration, run: gcloud config configurations describe:



gcloud config configurations describe [NAME]



To change the active configuration for a single command invocation, you can use the --configuration flag on any
	gcloud command.



To change the active configuration for all commands in your current terminal, you can set the environment variable
CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME to the name of the configuration you'd like to use.



Deleting a configuration
To delete a configuration, run: gcloud config configurations delete:



gcloud config configurations delete [NAME]gcl
Properties and flags
gcloud supports some global flags and command flags that have the same effect as SDK properties. For example, gcloud
supports both the --project flag and project property. Properties allow you to maintain the same settings across
command executions while flags affect command behavior on a per-invocation basis. Note that flags override properties
when both are set.



Configurations
A configuration is a named set of SDK properties. gcloud uses a configuration named default as the initial active
configuration; default is suitable for most use cases. However, you can also create additional configurations and
switch between them as required.



Listing properties
To list the properties in the active configuration, run gcloud config list:



gcloud config list
gcloud returns the list of properties:



[compute]
region = us-east1
zone = us-east1-d
[core]
account =
disable_usage_reporting = False
project = example-project
[metrics]
command_name = gcloud.config.list



Setting properties
To set a property in the active configuration, run gcloud config set:



gcloud config set project [PROJECT]
To set properties that are not in the core properties section, you must specify the section followed by a forward slash
before the property name:



gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b
Unsetting properties
To unset a property in the active configuration, run Use the gcloud config unset:



gcloud config unset disable_usage_reporting
Property types
SDK properties are organized into sections which group together related properties for convenience when you are viewing
property lists.



Core properties
The core section contains configuration properties for the gcloud command.



Name Description
account User account or service account used by gcloud and other SDK tools for authorization.
disable_color If set to True, prevents gcloud from printing messages in color to the terminal.
disable_prompts If set to True, suppresses prompts for all gcloud commands and assumes the default answer. If a command
requires user input and a default cannot be used, gcloud reports an error. Equivalent to the global --quiet flag.
disable_usage_reporting If set to True, disables collection of anonymous statistics on SDK usage. You set this value
when you install the SDK, but you can change it at any time.
log_http If set to True, enables writing of HTTP requests and responses to logs. If you want to see these messages in
your terminal, adjust your verbosity setting using the verbosity property or global --verbosity flag.
project Project ID of the current Cloud Platform project. You can override this value using the global --project flag.
trace_token Token provided by Google support to route traces of service requests for investigation of issues.
user_output_enabled Enables printing of command output to standard output and standard error in the terminal. If set to
False, output is suppressed.
verbosity Logging verbosity for gcloud commands. gcloud supports the following standard verbosity levels:
debug
info
warning
error
critical
none
Equivalent to using the global --verbosity flag.
