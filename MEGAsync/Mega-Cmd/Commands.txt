MEGAcmd User Guide




Here is an example of downloading a file using MEGAcmd. In this case we are downloading a file specified by a public
link, which does not require being logged in:



 mega-get https://mega.nz/#F!ABcD1E2F!gHiJ23k-LMno45PqrSTUvw /path/to/local/folder 





And here is an example of uploading a file using MEGAcmd, and making a link available to share it, that will expire
after 10 minutes.



mega-put /path/to/my/temporary_resource /exportedstuff/
mega-export -a /exportedstuff/temporary_resource --expire=10M | awk '{print $4}'



And here is an example of the power of using scriptable MEGAcmd commands in bash. In this case we are going to share
some promotional videos previously uploaded to MEGA:



 for i in $(mega-find /enterprise/video/promotional2015/may --pattern="*mpeg") 
 do  
 mega-export -a $i | awk '{print $4}'; 
 done 



In addition to running commands on request, MEGAcmd can also be configured to synchronise folders between your local
device and your MEGA account, or perform regular backups from your device to your MEGA account.



In order to enable synchronisation and backup features, and for efficiency running commands, MEGAcmd runs a server
process in the background which the MEGAcmd shell or the script commands forward requests to. The server keeps running
in the background until it is told to close with the quit command. If you want it to keep running when you quit the
interactive shell (to keep sync and backup runnign for example), use quit --only-shell.



Working with your MEGA account requires signing in with your email and password using the login command, though you can
download public links or upload to public folders without logging in. Logging in with your username and password starts
a Session, and causes some of your account such as the folder structure to be downloaded to your Local Cache.


Terminology and Descriptions



Interactive



Contact




A contact is someone (identified by their email address) that also has a MEGA account, who you can share files or
folders with, and can chat with on MEGAchat.


Remote Path




This refers to a file or a folder stored in your MEGA account, or a publicly available file or folder in the MEGA
cloud. Remote paths always use the '/' character as the separator between folder and file elements.



Some MEGAcmd commands allow the use of regular expressions in remote paths. You can check if the command supports those
by using the --help flag with the command. If you use these in the scriptable way, you need to escape characters that
would otherwise be intercepted and interpreted by the shell.


Local Path




This refers to a file or folder on the PC or device that MEGAcmd is running in.


Session




When you log in with your email and MEGA account password, that creates a session. The session exists until you log out
of it or kill it from another client. In MEGAcmd, use whoami -l to see all your open sessions across all devices, and
use killsession to close them. You can use other MEGA clients such as the phone app, or webclient to close these also.
Devices that were using a killed session will have their connection to MEGA closed immediately and will no longer have
access to your account, until you log in on them again. Syncs, backups, and webdavs are specific to a session, so
logging out will cause them to be cancelled.


Local Cache




Logging in with MEGAcmd creates your Local Cache, a subfolder of your home folder. MEGAcmd downloads and stores some
data in your Local Cache relating to your account, such as folder structure and contacts, for performance reasons. The
MEGAcmd background server keeps the local cache up to date when changes to your account occur from other clients. The
cache does contain a way for MEGAcmd to access your MEGA account when it starts up again if you have not specifically
logged out. The Local Cache also contains information from your Session, including sync, backup, and webdav
configurations. Logging out cleans the Local Cache, but also closes your session and the sync, backup, and webdav
configurations are wiped.


Synchronisation configurations




MEGAcmd can set up a synchronisation between a folder on your local machine and a folder in your MEGA account, using
the sync command. This is the same mechanism that MEGAsync uses. The synchronisation is two-way: the folders you
nominate to be synced will mirror any action! Whatever you add or delete in your sync folder on your device gets added
or deleted in your sync folder in your MEGA account. And additions or deletions in your synced folder in your MEGA
account will similarly be applied to your local synced folder. Files that are removed from sync folders are moved to a
hidden local folder (Rubbish/.debris inside your local sync folder, or SyncDebris folder in the Rubbish Bin of your
MEGA account).



Here is a very simple example of setting up a synchronisation with MEGAcmd:



 sync /path/to/local/folder /folder/in/mega 



You can set up more than one pair or folders to be synced, and you can also set a sync from another device to the same
folder, to achieve folder synchronisations between different devices. The changes are sent via your MEGA account rather
than directly between the devices in that case.



Additional information about synchronising folders is available in our Help Centre:
https://mega.nz/help/client/megasync/syncing


Backup configurations




MEGAcmd can set up a periodic copy of a local folder to your MEGA account using the backup command. Here is a simple
example that will back up a folder immediately and then at 4am each day, keeping the 10 most recent backups:



 backup /path/to/myfolder /remote/path --period="0 0 4 * * *" --num-backups=10 



For further information on backups, please see the backup command and the tutorial.


WebDAV configurations




MEGAcmd can set up access to folders or files in your MEGA account as if they were local folders and files on your
device using the webdav command. For example making the folder appear like a local drive on your PC, or providing a
hyperlink a browser can access, where the hyperlink is to your PC.



For further information on WebDAV, please see the webdav command and the tutorial.


Linux




On Linux, MEGAcmd commands are installed at /usr/bin and so will already be on your PATH. The interactive shell is
mega-cmd and the background server is mega-cmd-server, which will be automatically started on demand. The various
scriptable commands are installed at the same location, and invoke mega-exec to send the command to mega-cmd-server.



If you are using the scriptable commands in bash (or using the interactive commands in mega-cmd), the commands will
auto-complete.


MEGAcmdShell




For scriptable usage, the MEGAcmd commands are provided via installed .bat files which pass the command to the
MEGAcmdServer.exe. Provided you have set the PATH as above, you can use these like normal command line tools in
PowerShell:



 $env:PATH += ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\MEGAcmd" 
 mega-cd /my/favourite/folder 
 mega-ls 



Or in Command Prompt:



 set PATH=%LOCALAPPDATA%\MEGAcmd;%PATH% 
 mega-cd /my/favourite/folder  
 mega-ls 



And of course those can be invoked in your own .bat or .cmd files. Autocompletion is not available for the scriptable
commands, but is in the interactive shell.



Unicode is supported though it currently in the interactive shell it needs to be switched on, and to have a suitable
font selected; please execute help --unicode for the latest information. There are plans to improve this. Please report
any issues experienced to our support team.


Command Summary




These summaries use the usual conventions - [] indicates its content is optional, | indicates you should choose either
the item on the left or the one on the right (but not both)



Each command is described as it would be used in the interactive MEGAcmd shell, and the corresponding scriptable
command (which must be prefixed with mega-) works in the same way.



Commands referring to a remote path are talking about a file in your MEGA account online, whereas a local path refers
to a file or folder on your local device where MEGAcmd is running.



Verbosity: You can increase the amount of information given by any command by passing -v (-vv, -vvv, ...)

Command Detail




<a name='attr'>attr</a>



Lists/updates node attributes



 Usage: attr remotepath [-s attribute value|-d attribute] 



Options:
-s attribute value sets an attribute to a value
-d attribute removes the attribute





<a name='backup'>backup</a>



Sets up or controls backups. (example) (tutorial)



 Usage: backup (localpath remotepath --period="PERIODSTRING" --num-backups=N | [-lhda] [TAG|localpath]
  [--period="PERIODSTRING"] [--num-backups=N]) 



This command can be used to configure which folders to back up, and how often to do so.



If no argument is given it will list the configured backups.
To get extra info on backups use -l or -h (see Options below)



When a backup of a folder (localfolder) is established in a remote folder (remotepath)
MEGAcmd will create subfolder within the remote path with names like: "localfoldername_bk_TIME"
which shall contain a backup of the local folder at that specific time
In order to configure a backup you need to specify the local and remote paths,
the period and max number of backups to store (see Configuration Options below).
Once configured, you can see extended info asociated to the backup (See Display Options)
Notice that MEGAcmd server need to be running for backups to be created.



Display Options:
-l Show extended info: period, max number, next scheduled backup

  or the status of current/last backup

  -h Show history of created backups
  
    Backup states:
    While a backup is being performed, the backup will be considered and labeled as ONGOING
    If a transfer is cancelled or fails, the backup will be considered INCOMPLETE
    If a backup is aborted (see -a), all the transfers will be canceled and the backup be ABORTED
    If MEGAcmd server stops during a transfer, it will be considered MISCARRIED
    Notice that currently when MEGAcmd server is restarted, ongoing and scheduled transfers
    will be carried out nevertheless.
    If MEGAcmd server is not running when a backup is scheduled and the time for the next one has already arrived, an
    empty BACKUP will be created with state SKIPPED
    If a backup(1) is ONGOING and the time for the next backup(2) arrives, it won't start untill the previous one(1)
    is completed, and if by the time the first one(1) ends the time for the next one(3) has already arrived,
    an empty BACKUP(2) will be created with state SKIPPED

    --path-display-size=N Use a fixed size of N characters for paths



    Configuration Options:
    --period="PERIODSTRING" Period: either time in TIMEFORMAT (see below) or a cron like expresisions
    <div style='padding-left: 180pt'>
      Cron like period is formatted as follows
      - - - - - -
      | | | | | |
      | | | | | |
      | | | | | +---- Day of the Week (range: 1-7, 1 standing for Monday)
      | | | | +------ Month of the Year (range: 1-12)
      | | | +-------- Day of the Month (range: 1-31)
      | | +---------- Hour (range: 0-23)
      | +------------ Minute (range: 0-59)
      +-------------- Second (range: 0-59)
      examples:
      - daily at 04:00:00 (UTC): "0 0 4 * * *"
      - every 15th day at 00:00:00 (UTC) "0 0 0 15 * *"
      - mondays at 04.30.00 (UTC): "0 30 4 * * 1"
      TIMEFORMAT can be expressed in hours(h), days(d),
      minutes(M), seconds(s), months(m) or years(y)
      e.g. "1m12d3h" indicates 1 month, 12 days and 3 hours
      Notice that this is an uncertain measure since not all months
      last the same and Daylight saving time changes are not considered
      If possible use a cron like expresion
      Notice: regardless of the period expresion, the first time you establish a backup,
      it will be created inmediately

      --num-backups=N Maximum number of backups to store
      <div style='padding-left: 180pt'>
        After creating the backup (N+1) the oldest one will be deleted
        That might not be true in case there are incomplete backups:
        in order not to lose data, at least one COMPLETE backup will be kept

        Use backup TAG|localpath --option=VALUE to modify existing backups



        Management Options:
        -d TAG|localpath Removes a backup by its TAG or local path
        <div style='padding-left: 180pt'>
          Folders created by backup won't be deleted

          -a TAG|localpath Aborts ongoing backup



          Syncs are associated with your Session, so logging out will cancel them.

          Moves a file/folder into a new location (all remotes)



          Usage: cp srcremotepath dstremotepath|dstemail:



          If the location exists and is a folder, the source will be copied there.
          If the location doesn't exist, the file/folder will be renamed to the destination name given.



          If "dstemail:" provided, the file/folder will be sent to that user's inbox (//in)
          e.g: cp /path/to/file
          Remember the trailing ":", otherwise a file with the name of that user ("user@doma.in") will be created


          <a name='debug'>debug</a>

          


          Enters debugging mode (HIGHLY VERBOSE)



          Usage: debug



          For a finer control of log level see [`log`](#log)


          <a name='deleteversions'>deleteversions</a>

          


          Deletes previous versions of files, keeping the current version.



          Usage: deleteversions [-f] (--all | remotepath1 remotepath2 ...)



          This will permanently delete all historical versions of a file.
          The current version of the file will remain.
          Note: any file version shared to you from a contact will need to be deleted by them.



          Options:
          -f Force (no asking)
          --all Delete versions of all nodes. This will delete the version histories of all files (not current files).



          To see versions of a file use `ls --versions`.
          To see space occupied by file versions use `du --versions`.


          <a name='du'>du</a>

          


          Prints size used by files/folders (example)



          Usage: du [-h] [--versions] [remotepath remotepath2 remotepath3 ... ]



          remotepath can be a pattern (it accepts wildcards: ? and *. e.g.: f*00?.txt)



          Options:
          -h Human readable
          --versions Calculate size including all versions.



          You can remove all versions with `deleteversions` and list them with `ls --versions `


          <a name='exclude'>exclude</a>

          


          Manages exclusions in syncs.



          Usage: exclude [(-a|-d) pattern1 pattern2 pattern3 [--restart-syncs]]



          Options:
          -a pattern1 pattern2 ... adds pattern(s) to the exclusion list
          <div style='padding-left: 300pt'>
            (* and ? wildcards allowed)

            -d pattern1 pattern2 ... deletes pattern(s) from the exclusion list
            --restart-syncs Try to restart synchronizations.



            Changes will not be applied inmediately to actions being performed in active syncs.
            After adding/deleting patterns, you might want to:
            a) disable/reenable synchronizations manually
            b) restart MEGAcmd server
            c) use --restart-syncs flag. Caveats:
            This will cause active transfers to be restarted
            In certain cases --restart-syncs might be unable to re-enable a synchronization.
            In such case, you will need to manually resume it or restart MEGAcmd server.


            

            <a name='exit'>exit</a>

            


            Quits MEGAcmd



            Usage: exit [--only-shell]



            By default this command will exit both the interactive shell and the command server.
            To only exit current shell and keep server running, use `exit --only-shell`



            Exiting the server does not cancel the session, and the encrypted local cache of your account is kept on
            your PC.
            The session will be resumed when the service is restarted.


            <a name='export'>export</a>

            


            Prints/Modifies the status of current exports (example)



            Usage: export [-d|-a [--expire=TIMEDELAY] [-f]] [remotepath]



            Options:
            -a Adds an export (or modifies it if existing)
            --expire=TIMEDELAY Determines the expiration time of a node.
            <div style='padding-left: 180pt'>
              It indicates the delay in hours(h), days(d),
              minutes(M), seconds(s), months(m) or years(y)
              e.g. "1m12d3h" establish an expiration time 1 month,
              12 days and 3 hours after the current moment

              -f Implicitly accept copyright terms (only shown the first time an export is made)
              
                MEGA respects the copyrights of others and requires that users of the MEGA cloud service
                comply with the laws of copyright.
                You are strictly prohibited from using the MEGA cloud service to infringe copyrights.
                You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to,
                transmit or otherwise make available any files, data or content that infringes any copyright
                or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.

                -d Deletes an export



                If a remote path is given it'll be used to add/delete or in case of no option selected, it will display
                all the exports existing in the tree of that path


                <a name='find'>find</a>

                


                Find nodes matching a pattern



                Usage: find [remotepath] [-l] [--pattern=PATTERN] [--mtime=TIMECONSTRAIN] [--size=SIZECONSTRAIN]



                Options:
                -l Prints file info
                --pattern=PATTERN Pattern to match (it accepts wildcards: ? and *. e.g.: f*00?.txt)
                --mtime=TIMECONSTRAIN Determines time constrains, in the form: [+-]TIMEVALUE
                <div style='padding-left: 180pt'>
                  TIMEVALUE may include hours(h), days(d), minutes(M), seconds(s), months(m) or years(y)
                  Examples:
                  "+1m12d3h" shows files modified before 1 month, 12 days and 3 hours the current moment
                  "-3h" shows files modified within the last 3 hours
                  "-3d+1h" shows files modified in the last 3 days prior to the last hour

                  --size=SIZECONSTRAIN Determines size constrains, in the form: [+-]TIMEVALUE
                  <div style='padding-left: 180pt'>
                    TIMEVALUE may include (B)ytes, (K)ilobytes, (M)egabytes, (G)igabytes &amp; (T)erabytes
                    Examples:
                    "+1m12k3B" shows files bigger than 1 Mega, 12 Kbytes and 3Bytes
                    "-3M" shows files smaller than 3 Megabytes
                    "-4M+100K" shows files smaller than 4 Mbytes and bigger than 100 Kbytes



                    

                    <a name='get'>get</a>

                    


                    Downloads a remote file/folder or a public link (example)



                    Usage: get [-m] [-q] [--ignore-quota-warn] exportedlink#key|remotepath [localpath]



                    If the remotepath is a file, it will be downloaded to folder specified in localpath (or to the
                    current folder if not specified).
                    If the localpath (destination) already exists and is the same (by content) then nothing will be
                    done. If it differs, it will create a new file appending " (NUM)".
                    If the remotepath or exportedlink is a folder, the folder and its entire contents will be

                    https



                    Shows if HTTPS is used for transfers. Use https on to enable it.



                    Usage: https [on|off]



                    HTTPS is not necesary since all data is already encrypted before being stored or transfered anyway.
                    Enabling it will increase CPU usage and add network overhead.



                    This setting is ephemeral: it will reset for the next time you open MEGAcmd

                        Messages captured by the engine and libs




                        Regardless of the log level of the interactive shell, you can increase the amount of
                        information given by any command by passing `-v` (`-vv`, `-vvv`, ...)


                        <a name='login'>login</a>

                        Options:
                        --keep-session The current session is not closed, allowing logging back into it later using the
                        session ID rather than email/password.



                        MEGAcmd will still log back into your account automatically on restart if you specify
                        --keep-session, similar to exiting it without logging out.

                                  provided.
                                  In such case, the current remote working dir will be the destination for the upload.
                                  Mind that using wildcards for local paths will result in multiple paths.
