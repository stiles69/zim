Mosh Usage


Created Saturday 28 July 2018





Usage
Replaces interactive SSH. Instant keystroke response, robust to roaming. But you'll need working UDP.
Typical usage
$ mosh chewbacca.norad.mil
Mosh will log the user in via SSH, then start a connection on a UDP port between 60000 and 61000.



Different username
$ mosh potus@ackbar.bls.gov
Server binary outside path
$ mosh --server=/tmp/mosh-server r2d2
The user can specify an alternate path for the mosh-server on the remote host. The server binary can even be installed
in the user's home directory.



Selecting Mosh UDP port
$ mosh -p 1234 darth
Useful when the server is behind a port-forwarder or NAT.



Selecting SSH port
$ mosh --ssh="ssh -p 2222" figrindan
Other SSH options
$ mosh --ssh="~/bin/ssh -i ./identity" fett
Disable instant echo
$ mosh --predict=never niennunb
The -n switch is a synonym. By contrast, passing --predict=always or -a will enable instant local echo even on
low-delay links.



With a command
$ mosh pello -- screen -dr
This reattaches to a long-running screen session.



Ending the connection
Normally, logout or exit on the remote host will close the session. Mosh accepts the escape sequence Ctrl-^ .
(typically typed with Control-Shift-6, then a period) to end the connection forcibly. To send a literal Ctrl-^, type
Ctrl-^ ^.
