transmission-daemon config


Created Thursday 24 May 2018




settings.json





Configure
There are many settings which can be configured. This how-to focus on tweaking the default configuration file for use
with Ubuntu server.



transmission-daemon will start automatically each time you start your server, with the settings defined in
/var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/settings.json



Make sure the Transmission daemon is not running when changing the config file otherwise your changes will be over
written.





sudo service transmission-daemon stop
edit /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/settings.json



sudo nano /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/settings.json
Username and Password
The default rpc-username and password is “transmission”



Change if increased security is required



Change it to whatever you want (any password will work). After next restart the password will be rewritten in SHA1
encrypted format for security reasons.





"rpc-password": "{62b16db87b89a91dd49a5110a7cafc06d20eb4f2wtK6kqPj",
"rpc-username": "transmission",
Whitelist
This must be changed for remote access



rpc-whitelist defines access to transmission. Localhost (127.0.0.1) is defined by default. I added ,192.268.*.* to
allow any machine on my LAN access.





"rpc-whitelist": "127.0.0.1,192.168.*.*",
"umask" parameter
You will also have to set the "umask" parameter in Transmission’s settings file to “2” (default is 18) for the account
user to have full access to files/folders created by Transmission.





"umask": 2,
Transmission Restart
After configuration change, restart transmission



sudo service transmission-daemon start
Default File Directory
Place a torrent file in this directory for automatic file download





/var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/


Configure Users and Permissions


It is recommended that Transmission runs under it’s own username for security reasons. This creates a few issues with
file and folder access by Transmission as well as your account (let us assume it is user).



Add the username user to the group debian-transmission:





sudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission user
NOTE: Change "user" to you own Ubuntu user login name.



NOTE: When adding a user to a new group, the user must log out and log back in for it to take affect. A reboot will
also accomplish this.


Transmission Daemon


Starting and Stopping Transmission Daemon
After install Transmission, the daemon will be started automatically (but not accessible yet). You can start and stop
Transmission daemon using the following commands





sudo service transmission-daemon start
sudo service transmission-daemon stop
sudo service transmission-daemon reload
Note:Restarting (or reloading) Transmission daemon can be tricky. Restarting the the daemon (while it is already
running) would rewrite the Transmission settings files to its original state. In other words, restarting the
Transmission daemon would reset all the custom settings you saved.


Bash Aliases


Create shortcuts add the following bash aliases to /home/user/.bash_aliases





sudo nano /home/user/.bash_aliases



    alias t-start='sudo service transmission-daemon start'
alias t-stop='sudo service transmission-daemon stop'
alias t-reload='sudo service transmission-daemon reload'
alias t-list='transmission-remote -n 'transmission:transmission' -l'
alias t-basicstats='transmission-remote -n 'transmission:transmission' -st'
alias t-fullstats='transmission-remote -n 'transmission:transmission' -si'





    source /home/user/.bash_aliases
    Example

        #---------------------------End Transmission--------------------






        user@SVR:~$
        will run
        transmission-remote -n 'transmission:transmission' -l



        Web Interface
        With your browser you can now add torrents, download and seed. You can also configure many transmission
        settings.

        Port Forward


        There are many options but one of the more important one's is port forwarding



        Check your ports are open



        USE PORT FORWARDING!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WILL HAVE TO MAP A PORT FROM THE ROUTER!!!!
        DO NOT ENABLE uTP FOR PEER COMMUNICATON!



        If you port says "closed" you will need to configure your internet router to forward the correct port to
            your Transmission server/client. Google "How to port forward"



        If you don't use "Port Forward" another option is "UPnP". Once again this depends on you internet router
            setup.



        Command Line Interface
        With a headless server full control of Transmission requires CLI



        Transmission Create
        Create a torrent file with transmission CLI. Torrent files can be generated from either a single file or
        directories. The example below is a directory example





        transmission-create -o /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/files.torrent -c "My comments" -t
        udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969 ~/torrent/complete/
        -o /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/files.torrent



        New torrent name and where to store the torrent



        -c "My comments"



        Any comments to be attached to the file



        -t udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80



        -t udp://open.demonii.com:1337



        -t udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969



        -t udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969



        Trackers for the torrents, more than one tracker is recommended in case one or more goes down.



        ~/torrent/complete/



        Directory to be made into a torrent. If a single file is required use this format
        "/var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/MyFile.txt"



        For more information about "transmission-create"





        transmission-create -h
