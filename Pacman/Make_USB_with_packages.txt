Make USB with packages


Created Tuesday 13 February 2018



Then you can burn the "Packages" folder to a CD/DVD or transfer it to a USB stick, external HDD, etc.



To install:




	Mount the media:




	# mkdir /mnt/repo
# mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/repo    #For a CD/DVD.
# mount /dev/sdxY /mnt/repo   #For a USB stick.


	
		Edit pacman.conf and add this repository before the other ones (e.g. extra, core, etc.). This is important. Do
			not just uncomment the one on the bottom. This way it ensures that the files from the CD/DVD/USB take precedence
			over those in the standard repositories:{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
	
	/etc/pacman.conf
	[custom]
	SigLevel = PackageRequired
	Server = file:///mnt/repo/Packages
	}}}



	
		Finally, synchronize the pacman database to be able to use the new repository: pacman -Syu
