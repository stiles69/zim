Cloud-Init Sample Config Files


Created Wednesday 24 October 2018



Here you can find a collection of sample configurations to improve your first-boot experience using HypriotOS.



Beginning with HypriotOS 1.7.0 we have switched to cloud-init which gives you much more power to customize your device
automatically during the first initial boot.



You can either use our flash tool with option -u or --userdata to specify the YAML file. The flash tool will copy it to
the SD card right after flashing.



Otherwise copy the YAML file to the boot partition of the SD card to the /boot/user-data file.



Quick installation:



$ flash -u your-cloud-init.yml

$ ssh pirate@black-pearl.local
login with username "pirate", password "hypriot"
