===== How to install Arch Linux on RaspberryPi =====
Start fdisk to partition the SD card:

**fdisk /dev/sdX**

At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one:
    
Type o. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
Type p to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
Type n, then p for primary, 1 for the first partition on the drive, press ENTER to

        
accept the default first sector, then type +100M for the last sector.

            
Type **t**, then **c** to set the first partition to type W95 FAT32 (LBA).
Type **n**, then **p** for primary, **2** for the second partition on the drive, and then press
**ENTER** twice to accept the default first and last sector.

                    
Write the partition table and exit by typing **w**.

=== Create and mount the FAT filesystem: ===
                        
**mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1**
**mkdir boot**
**mount /dev/sdX1 boot**

== Create and mount the ext4 filesystem: ==
                            
**mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2**
**mkdir root**
**mount /dev/sdX2 root**

== Download and extract the root filesystem (as root, not via sudo): ==
                                
**wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz**
(this is the ARMv6 verison for RPi1 and 0)
OR
**wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz**
(this is ARMv7 version for RPi2/3)
OR
**wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-3-latest.tar.gz**
(ARMv8 x64 version for v3 ONLY, not fully supported)

**bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-<rpi-version>-latest.tar.gz -C root sync**

== Move boot files to the first partition: ==
                                                
**mv root/boot/* boot**

== Unmount the two partitions: ==
                                                    
**umount boot root**

Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect ethernet, and apply 5V power.
Use the serial console or SSH to the IP address given to the board by power. The default root password is '**root**'.
