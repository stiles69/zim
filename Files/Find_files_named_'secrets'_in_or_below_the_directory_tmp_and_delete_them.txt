Find files named 'secrets' in or below the directory tmp and delete them


Created Sunday 13 May 2018





$ find /tmp -name secrets -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f
Processing filenames in such a way that file or directory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or
	newlines are correctly handled. The -name test comes before the -type test in order to avoid having to call stat(2) on
	every file.
