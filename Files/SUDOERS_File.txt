====== SUDOERS File ======
Created Friday 30 November 2018

The sudoers file located at: **/etc/sudoers**, contains the rules that users must follow when using the sudo command.

The first thing I do when I install a new Linux is to use **visudo** to edit the sudoers file. And I always give **my account root rights**, then I can run commands as root without switching users.

In order to use sudo you first need to configure the **sudoers** file. The sudoers file is located at **/etc/sudoers**. And you should not edit it directly, you need to use the **visudo** command.

Once you enter **visudo** command, you will see something like this:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
# /etc/sudoers
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#

Defaults        env_reset

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
}}}

//Almost all lines are commented out, the one that matters in this sudoers file example is://
**root ALL=(ALL) ALL**
//This line means: The root user can execute from ALL terminals, acting as ALL (any) users, and run ALL (any) command.//

The **first** part is the **user**, the **second** is the **terminal** from where the user can use sudo command, the **third** part is **which users he may act as**, and the **last** one, is which **commands** he may run when using sudo.

**First=user**
**Second=terminal**
**Third=which users may act as**
**Last=Commands can be used**

You can also create aliases for: users -> User_Alias, run commands as other users -> Runas_Alias, host -> Host_Alias and command -> Cmnd_Alias
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
User_Alias OPERATORS = joe, mike, jude Runas_Alias OP = root, operator Host_Alias OFNET = 10.1.2.0/255.255.255.0 Cmnd_Alias PRINTING = /usr/sbin/lpc, /usr/bin/lprm
}}}

//As you can see the alias OPERATORS includes the users joe, mike and jude, the alias OP includes the users root and operator, alias OFNET includes the network 10.1.2.0 (all the C class), and the command alias PRINTING includes the commands lpc and lprm.//

So, a typical sudoers file may look like this:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
User_Alias     OPERATORS = joe, mike, jude
 Runas_Alias    OP = root, operator
 Host_Alias     OFNET = 10.1.2.0/255.255.255.0
 Cmnd_Alias     PRINTING = /usr/sbin/lpc, /usr/bin/lprm

OPERATORS ALL=ALL

#The users in the OPERATORS group can run any command from
 any terminal.

linus ALL=(OP) ALL

# The user linus can run any command from any terminal as any 
user in the OP group (root or operator).

user2 OFNET=(ALL) ALL

# user user2 may run any command from any machine in the 
OFNET network, as any user.

user3 ALL= PRINTING

# user user3 may run lpc and lprm from any machine.

go2linux ALL=(ALL) ALL

# user go2linux may run any command from any machine acting
 as any user. (like Ubuntu)
}}}

If you want not to be asked for a password use this form:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
go2linux ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
}}}
