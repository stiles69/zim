Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours.


Created Sunday 13 May 2018



find $HOME -mtime 0
This command works this way because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any
	remainder is discarded. That means that to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a modification in the past which
	is less than 24 hours ago.
