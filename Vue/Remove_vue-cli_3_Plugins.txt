====== Remove vue-cli 3 Plugins ======
Created Fri 30 November 2018

==== 1) Uninstall the plugin package using NPM or Yarn ====
First, uninstall the plugin manually using NPM or Yarn. You can run npm uninstall vue-cli-plugin-apollo and that will remove the packages associated with that plugin.

=== NPM ===
**npm uninstall vue-cli-plugin-apollo -D**

=== Yarn ===
**yarn remove vue-cli-plugin-apollo**

==== 2) Manually remove all modified and created files from the plugin ====
If you try to serve your project by running npm run serve it most likely won’t work immediately. You’ve already removed the vue-cli-plugin-apollo package using NPM or Yarn.

Now, you’ll have to go in and manually remove all of the changes that the plugin made to your plugin.
