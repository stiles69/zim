Then, once logged in, you can delete the demouser account if you like. Open a terminal, su to root, then:
pi64 ~ # userdel --remove demouser
userdel: demouser mail spool (/var/spool/mail/demouser) not found



Installing New Packages Under Gentoo
You can add any additional packages you like to your RPi3. To search for available packages, you can use the
(pre-installed) eix tool. For example, to search for all packages with 'hex editor' in their description:



demouser@pi64 ~ $ eix --description --compact "hex.editor"



Option 2: Remove Xfce4 and Migrate to a Textual Console System
To purge the GUI desktop (and apps) from your system completely, useful if e.g., you want to maintain a headless
server, is also straighforward.



Begin by following the steps in option 1, above, but remove all lines in /var/lib/portage/world, except for
dev-embedded/rpi3-64bit-meta (which must be retained).



demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo mousepad /var/lib/portage/world &amp;>/dev/null&amp;
(this will open the file for editing)



Caution: do not delete the dev-embedded/rpi3-64bit-meta line as this is necessary to keep e.g. the Xfce4 desktop, and
other support services and applications, installed.



Once the file only contains packages you want to keep, save it, and close mousepad.



The unwanted packages will now have a 'reference count' of zero, but are not actually removed from your system yet. To
do that, issue:



demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo emerge --ask --depclean



Once the emerge --depclean completes, fix any broken shared library dependencies; issue:



demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo revdep-rebuild
This will normally end up being a no-op, but it is always safest to check.



With that done, open a terminal at the (slimmed down!) desktop, and issue:


Extra Commands


Remove GUI:
pi64 ~ # rc-update del xdm default



You can also reclaim the memory reserved for the vc4 graphics driver (this is optional). To do so, issue:



pi64 ~ # vim -w /boot/config.txt
and comment out the following line, so it reads:



#dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d,cma-256



To change the time zone, e.g. for Germany:



root #timedatectl set-timezone https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Localization/Guide#Environment_variables_for_locales



To set the system clock:



root #timedatectl set-time "2012-12-17 12:30:59"



At runtime, to check the current hardware clock time:



root #hwclock --show
To set the hardware clock to the current system clock:



root #hwclock --systohc
