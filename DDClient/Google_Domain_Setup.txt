Using the API to update your Dynamic DNS record
Dynamic DNS client software automatically updates your dynamic DNS record. You can perform updates manually with the
API by making making a POST request (GET is also allowed) to the following url:
https://domains.google.com/nic/update



The API requires HTTPS. Here’s an example request:
https://aDqLBXBWQ2Zyfzos:GeM3D8JK5sBpLF3k@domains.google.com/nic/update?hostname=network.roguedesigns.us&amp;myip=173.29.176.159



Note: You must set a user agent in your request as well. Web browsers will generally add this for you when testing via
the above url. In any case, the final HTTP request sent to our servers should look something like this:



Example HTTP query:



https:username:password@domains.google.com/nic/update?hostname=subdomain.yourdomain.com&amp;myip=1.2.3.4//



POST /nic/update?hostname=subdomain.yourdomain.com&amp;myip=1.2.3.4 HTTP/1.1
Host: domains.google.com
Authorization: Basic base64-encoded-auth-string User-Agent: Chrome/41.0 your_email@yourdomain.com



Request Parameters:



ParameterRequired/OptionalDescription
username:passwordRequiredThe generated username and password associated with the host that is to be updated.
hostnameRequiredThe hostname to be updated.
myipOptional
(Required if you have an IPv6 address)The IP address to which the host will be set. If not supplied, we’ll use the IP
of the agent that sent the request.
Note: Because the address must be an IPv4 address, myip is required if your agent uses an IPv6 address. You can check
your agent’s IP address by going to https://domains.google.com/checkip.



offlineOptionalSets the current host to offline status. If an update request is performed on an offline host, the host
is removed from the offline state.
Allowed values are
yes
no
One of the following responses will be returned after the request is processed.



Please ensure you interpret the response correctly, or you risk having your client blocked from our system.
